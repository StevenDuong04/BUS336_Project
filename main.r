# Bioretention Condition Assessment (BCA) Analysis - 2022 vs 2024
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
# This code analyzes the condition of bioretention sites over time (2022 to 2024)
# to understand how stewardship programs (No Stewardship, Seeding Stewardship, Green Streets)
# affect site performance. Goal is to identify trends, changes in condition scores,
# and which specific features (like Vegetation, Soil, Inlet/Outlet) contribute to
# improvements or declines in site condition.
#
# Workflow Overview:
# 1. Load necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and regression.
# 2. Import the 2022 and 2024 BCA Excel datasets and inspect them.
# 3. Clean the datasets:
#    - Remove demolished/missing sites.
#    - Convert stewardship to a categorical variable.
#    - Convert relavent columns to numeric.
# 4. Align 2022 and 2024 data by common GRI ID to allow year-to-year comparison.
# 5. Combine datasets into one for analysis and create a year and stewardship column for 2022 data.
# 6.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
#    - Correlation analysis between numeric variables in 2024.
#    - Linear regression to check the effect of stewardship on condition scores in 2024 (Cross-sectional regression)
#    - Compute the change in condition score (2024 - 2022) and classify sites as Improved, Worsened, or No Change.
#    - Estimate future condition scores for 2026 by extrapolating the observed changes from 2022 to 2024.
#      -This is a simple, informal forecast and not a formal predictive model.
#    - Summarize change metrics (average, median) by stewardship type.
# 6.2 Feature-level analysis:
#    - Calculate numeric feature changes between 2022 and 2024 for each site.
#    - Pivot longer to tidy format and compute average/median changes by stewardship type.
#    - Identify which features contributed most to improvements or declines in condition scores.
# 7. Export cleaned datasets and summary tables for Tableau visualization and further analysis.
#
# Expected Insights:
# - Determine whether stewardship programs improve overall condition scores.
# - Identify which features of the sites (e.g., Vegetation Score, Soil Score, Planting Bed, CDA Score)
#   drive changes in site performance.
# - Quantify differences between stewardship types and highlight areas for management focus.
